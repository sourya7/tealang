Tealang 
-------

Tealang is an experimental language designed as a part of my Senior Project at Brigham Young University - Idaho. Speed is not my main concern for this project. If I really wanted speed, I would have gone with LLVM for code generation. A major aspect to this project is to simply learn how to design large systems.

The language specification can be found in the wiki. [Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/sourya7/tealang/wiki/Home)
