1. Overview
Tealang is a general purpose object-oriented language. The design philosophy behind the language is to improve readability by forcing verbose programming constructs.
Tealang, at its core, is represented by objects and relations between them. Everything in the language is an object. This includes the classes and the data types. Each of these objects are tagged with their values and type.
